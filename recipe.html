            <h1> HOW TO MAKE </h1>
            <ol>
                <li>If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for at least 30 minutes or overnight. Place the beef steak between two pieces of saran wrap (cling film) or parchment paper.
                     Using a kitchen mallet or the base of a small heavy saucepan, pound the steak pieces until they are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick.</li>
                     <li>Cut the meat, onion, and bell pepper into approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm)-sized cubes and set aside. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the salt, black pepper, cumin, turmeric, chili flakes, crushed garlic, lemon juice, and half of the olive oil. 
                        Add the beef pieces, onion, and bell pepper to the bowl, combine, cover and allow
                         to marinate at room temperature for at least two hours, or overnight in the fridge.</li>
                         <li>Skewer the beef chunks, followed by the onion, then the bell pepper. Keep alternating until the skewer is full. Lightly brush a grill pan or rack with oil. Heat the grill pan over high heat or place your rack on top of a charcoal grill if using one. If using a charcoal grill, make sure it is on medium heat. Grill the mishkaki (mshakiki) in batches for eight to ten minutes on each side,
                             or slightly more if you prefer them more charred. Keep basting with olive oil and turning as you go.</li>
                             <li>Place the mishkaki beef skewers on a large plate, cover them with a piece of aluminum foil, and allow them to rest for 5 minutes before serving. Serve with any type of flatbread such as naan, chapati, rice (or their low-carb alternatives). Mshakiki can also be served as they are, as an appetizer!
                            </li>
